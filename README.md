## Cats name and photo randomizer ðŸŽ²
```

Thanks ðŸ˜º
```

### Description
```
Here is my project :
It allows you to find a name for each cat.
You can choose to edit either the name or the photo.

The API I used for cat photos is this:

https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search
As requested you will see a 25s modal appear after a request for a new photo.

For the cat names I used the "cat-names" dependency which allows you to have random names.

This project was carried out with Vue 3 and without a CSS framework

Take a look !
```
